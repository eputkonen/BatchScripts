# BatchScripts
Batch Scripts for PCs written by Eric Putkonen

These were written for work that used a PC.

CompareTextFiles
- This was used to compare two text files of our employee directory.  As a recruiter, I was using this to keep myself in the loop on who left the company and know when my new hires were added to the directory.  This batch script compared DirectoryOld.txt and DirectoryNew.txt and spit out differences.

DeleteOldFileAndCopyNewAsOld
- After using CompareTextFiles, I executed this script to delete DirectoryOld.txt and create a new one based on DirectoryNew.txt.  Now I am ready to copy and paste the directory into DirectoryNew.txt and run CompareTextFiles next week.
